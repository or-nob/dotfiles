# vim-configs
This is a nvim config for working on C/C++ projects in nvim. Please, note this is geared towards using in terminals for unix-like (macOS & Linux) OSes. So, this might not work well in windows or GUI vims.

## Environments tested in include:
- macOS Sequoia + iTerm + tmux
- Ubuntu 16.04 + GNOME Terminal + tmux
- Ubuntu 22.04 + GNOME Terminal + tmux

## To install run the following one by one.
`git clone https://github.com/or-nob/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`<br/>
`cd ~/.dotfiles/nvim/`<br/>
`./install.sh`<br/>
`source ~/.dotfiles/nvim/`<br/>
`nvim .`<br/>

Then, from vim command line:
`:PluginInstall`<br/>
